# This file lists some commits that should be ignored by git blame.
# These commits are considered "useless" and should not be attributed
# to the current history.

# In order to see the effects of this file, you must configure Git
# to use the .git-blame-ignore-revs file for blame operations.
# This can be done by running the following command:
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This configuration can be added to your global Git configuration
# (~/.gitconfig), or to the local Git configuration for the repository
# (.git/config).
